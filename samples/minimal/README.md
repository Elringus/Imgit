# Minimal Sample

Example on using imgit directly, without bundlers:

1. Run `build.ts` with [deno](https://deno.com): `deno run -A build.ts`;
2. Wait for the encoding operations to complete, which may take a while;
3. Open local HTTP server url printed in the console (http://localhost:3000).

Examine `index.html` and `build.ts` sources for details.
